This repository contains all the lab works and assignments completed for the Machine Learning Laboratory course at my university. It includes implementations of fundamental machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, SVM, clustering, and neural networks. The labs were developed using Python and popular libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn. Each experiment focuses on understanding the theoretical concepts and applying them to real or synthetic datasets to gain practical experience in building and evaluating machine learning models.
